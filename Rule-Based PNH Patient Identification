Briefing Document: Rule-Based PNH Patient Identification Tool
________________________________________
Project Overview:
The objective is to develop a rule-based, web-based tool that enables healthcare professionals (HCPs) to screen patients during consultations and identify potential PNH (Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria) cases using a structured algorithm.
________________________________________
Core Requirements:
•	Rule-Based Engine:
The logic follows the provided clinical algorithm exactly as structured in the attached in the file the file shared.
•	Interactive HCP Interface:
o	Web-based, intuitive UI designed for use in real-time during patient screening.
o	YES/NO decision tree with clear navigation (YES answers on the right, NO on the left).
o	Optimized for fast clinical use in outpatient settings.
•	Report Generation: 
o	A report to be generated after each screening session.
o	The report should include:
	Answers given
	The decision path followed
	Final recommendation:
	“High Potential PNH Patient –”
	“Might be potential”
o	Report to be downloadable and printable (PDF preferred).
•	Bulk Upload Feature:
o	Ability to upload multiple patient entries via Excel/CSV.
o	Tool should process the batch and return individual screening results and reports for each patient.
